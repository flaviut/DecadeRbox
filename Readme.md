## Pimp up your thumbwheel switch  ##
and build a resistance decade box.
replacement conctact boards for the smaller (h=~18mm) thumbwheel switches. 
PCB thickness: 0.6mm or less.

There are two versions of the board:
BBM : break before make and
MBB : make before break.

Design made using SprintLayout6.

Credit for the make-before-break pad shape idea goes to Dave @ eevblog.com forum. Thanks!

Gerber file directory contains multiple versions of the board: single versions, optimized for typical under 50x50mm prototype orders, single and mixed BBM&MBB types.
